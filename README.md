üöó Lane Detection using OpenCV
This project implements a lane detection system using Python and OpenCV. It performs real-time or image-based detection of lane lines from road images using classical computer vision techniques like grayscale conversion, noise reduction, Canny edge detection, masking with region of interest, and Hough Transform for line detection.

üì¶ Requirements

Install OpenCV:
bash
pip install opencv-python
